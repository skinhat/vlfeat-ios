<b>vlfeat-ios</b>
This is Vlfeat running on IOS and includes a simple demo with 'vl_solve_linear_system_2' that will run on your iphone.
Vlfeat is a computer vision library at vlfeat.org.

The code is a fork of an old version youngdueks ios-OpenCV-interface which happened to include vlfeat for iOS but has 
since been removed.
